    <h1>Thursday Morning!</h1>
    <p>It's Thursday Morning and we are in class to learn how to make a simple webpage using sublime text. From our knowledge of HTML, we structure the webpage using just text with various header styles, divs and paragraphs. To get a beautiful and attractive webpage, we style using CSS that we learned in the very beginning of this program.</p>
