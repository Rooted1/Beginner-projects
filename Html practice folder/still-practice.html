                I'm so happy you wanna learn more about me!<br>
                I am Ruth Obe, a web developer at Lagos Study Program, Lagos. I find it so interesting to code as it challenges me to try out new ways of doing things. It helps my logical thinking and my versatility. At first, I never taught I was going to be doing this, but since when I put aside the notion that this was meant for guys alone, I have always been at my best in it.<br>
